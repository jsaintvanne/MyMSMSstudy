Metabolite identification is a crucial step when trying to understand the courses of a disease on the metabolomic level. They demonstrate the MetFrag workflow, which goes a first step to annotate molecules from compound (metabolite) databases to MS/MS (tandem mass spectrometry) spectra. This annotation is based on the mapping of in silico generated fragments to the experimental spectra.

### 2
#### Problem

I can't find the same compund that I have on the result file of `STD_MIX1`

#### Solution

?

### 3
#### Problem
