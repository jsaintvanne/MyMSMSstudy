Metabolite identification is a crucial step when trying to understand the courses of a disease on the metabolomic level. They demonstrate the MetFrag workflow, which goes a first step to annotate molecules from compound (metabolite) databases to MS/MS (tandem mass spectrometry) spectra. This annotation is based on the mapping of in silico generated fragments to the experimental spectra.

## Problems
I'm using the Galaxy of PhenoMeNal to test my datasets and differents problems appears :
- with the file `STD_MIX1` the function `camera-find-isotopes` doesn't work.
- I can't find the same compund that I have on the result file of `STD_MIX1`
