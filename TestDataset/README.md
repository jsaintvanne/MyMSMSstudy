# DATASETS

A lot of datasets are possible to verify tools. We have different format of datasets to test :
- one file containing MS1 and MS2, with polarity + and - (STD_MIX1, 2 and 3)
- one file containing MS1 and MS2 with polarity + only (STD_MIX1, 2 and 3)
- two files, one containing MS1 scans and the other containing MS2 spectra (LABERCA)
