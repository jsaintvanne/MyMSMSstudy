# MyMSMSstudy

This repository had been made to know the avancement on my project that I'm working on in the CNRS of Roscoff.

## Working place

I'm working at the "Station Biologique" of Roscoff since the 14<sup>th</sup> January 2018 as a bioinformatician.

`Station Biologique de Roscoff - UPMC/CNRS - FR2424`  
`Place Georges Teissier 29680 Roscoff FRANCE`  
`tel: ++33 (0)2 98 29 56 46 (interne : 415)`

I'm a part of the ABiMS (Analyses and Bioinformatics for Marine Science) team (http://abims.sb-roscoff.fr)

 I'm also working for the Workflow4Metabolomics project (http://workflow4metabolomics.org)

## My project

My project during this time in Roscoff is to develop a tool on Galaxy to find all the possible compounds in a sample passed in a mass spectrometry.

Some tools already exists and my aim is to increase their power and their flexibility to obtain a great tool which will be understand and easy to use by all the users.

Three tools are already in studying :
  - MS2process
  - msPurity
  - PhenoMeNal tools

I built a repository for each tool wherein I will describe the advancement of study, the different problems I'm facing and the development that I can bring for it.

There are also a repository for each dataset that I'm using and a README file to explain each one. Differents formats of dataset are used by chimists and we should try our workflows with the most popular of course but it could be great to have tools which can be used with all datasets possible.

It should be great to also have an universal file format for all metabolomics data because each file format is a little different and need different tools to use them in one workflow.
