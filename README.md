## My project

My project during this time in Roscoff is to develop a tool on Galaxy to find all the possible compounds in a sample passed in a mass spectrometry.

Some tools already exists and my aim is to increase their power and their flexibility to obtain a great tool which will be understand and easy to use by all the users.

Three tools are already in studying :
  - MS2process
  - msPurity
  - PheNoMENal tools

I built a repository for each tool wherein I will describe the advancement of study, the different problems I'm facing and the development that I can bring for it.
