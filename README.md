This repository had been made to know the avancement on my project that I'm working on in the CNRS of Roscoff.


## Working place

I work in the "Station Biologique" of Roscoff since the 14th January 2018 as a bioinformatician.

I'm a part of the ABiMS (Analyses and Bioinformatics for Marine Science) team (http://abims.sb-roscoff.fr)

 I'm also working for the Workflow4Metabolomics project (http://workflow4metabolomics.org)


## My project

My project during this time in Roscoff is to develop a tool on Galaxy to find all the possible compounds in a sample passed in a mass spectrometry.
